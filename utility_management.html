          <h2>The Problem</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Diagnosis: Currently, AppFolio Utility Management has been a blackbox experience for users. This has led to an erosion of trust, lack of user role empowerment and has blocked property managers from being able to address errors and resolve resident questions.</p>
<p>Challenge: The team needs to find a way to improve transparency by giving a satisfactory explanations of how resident charges are calculated. </p>
<p>Timeframe: This is the team’s primary focus for H2 2021 and the team is empowered to determine the scope of the solution, but should be prioritizing an agile mindset.</p>

          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>The first necessary step was to collect all secondary research completed from previous teams and market validation efforts. Then, I went to customer service cases submitted over the last 90 days and manually tagged those based on where in the user workflow painpoints were surfacing. I then created a path in Pendo to determine where the user was going after they visited the initial workflow in question. The image seen is from the Pendo reports and shows that after viewing the utility management page, users were often going to the tenant's pages to gather more information to determine the validity of charges. A hypothesis began to form within the team that users were needing both occupancy information and their lease information. Eliminating the need to go on this treasure hunt became part of the trasnparency conversation.</p>

          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>I then facilitated a design studio for the team to align on the state of the product and it's problem, help determine and define success, and from there, generate some ideas for solutions we could explore. Each member got a chance to present and then the team could critique. We then did a prioritization exercise to determine what pieces of each solution we thought was most important to validate. We landed on pursuing the ideas that a property manager most likely needed to know the billback formula applied for a property, relevant lease dates and general unit data (square footage, total number of occuoants, etc.).</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>Based on the designs presented I put together some mockups that represented the team’s ideas in a format that was more design system-friendly. I also laid out some of the various scenarios to represent that different designs supported varying levels of granularity and detail. After some more critiquing and domain knowledge sharing, it became clear that these approaches, while low effort, would not likely satisfy the problem in a way that is noticeably efficient or effective.
The next day, I came in with a different design based on that feedback. The team felt good about showing that to a customer to see if it met their expectations.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The next day, I came in with a different design based on that feedback. This design applied the feedback that the devs initially had about wanting to continue to build in utility-app and adding a tertiary level to utility management gave us more screen real estate to work with. The team felt good about showing that to a customer to see if it met their expectations.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>I recruited some customers based on very specific criteria. Each customer was a domain expert and current user, but their roles regarding utility billing were all different, and the scenarios for which they needed an explanation of charges was also different. I wanted to see what pieces of the design they all agreed on.
In general, the basic skeleton, the navigation and high level details all had high agreement, so the PM and I felt confident about starting to build out the larger part of the design while we ironed out and iterated on the other parts of the solution we felt necessary for the second release. The mockup here illustrates all of the new content tested but does not indicate the pieces with highest agreement.  </p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <p> For our first release, we added an in-app announcement in addition to a feedback button which allowed the user submit a likert scale response and a free form response to indicate satisfaction. I tagged the feedback and reported any emerging themes.</p>
